Dear examiner, 
The r code files (plo1-4.r) are designed to execute straightforward from the source data file in the net. Once you execute the first file (plot1.r), it downloads the zip file of the dataset to your current working directory, named a1.zip. You must have it anyway. Then it unzips and reads the file (to 'cc1' dataset). Having executed the first file, you will be able to execute the subsequent files (plot2-4.r) by just reading the source file (a1.zip) from your current directory. Each file produces a plot in png format, named plot1-4.png.  Should there be any problem, please contact me on a.farrokhniae@gmail.com 

Regards
Amir Farokh
